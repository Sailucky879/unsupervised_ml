1. Data Loading and Exploration
1.1 Initial Data Overview
The dataset contains 4,467 entries with the following columns:

idx: Unique identifier for each talk

main_speaker: Name of the main speaker

title: Title of the talk

details: Detailed description of the talk

posted: Posting date of the talk

url: URL link to the talk

num_views: Number of views (mostly missing, with only 209 non-null values)

1.2 Key Observations
The 'num_views' column has significant missing data (4,258 null values)

Most talks were posted in recent years, with 2020 being the most common year

The dataset spans from 2006 to 2020

2. Data Preprocessing
2.1 Handling Missing Values
Removed rows with missing 'main_speaker' values (only 1 row)

Kept all other columns as they are, even with missing 'num_views'

2.2 Feature Engineering
Extracted 'year' and 'month' from the 'posted' column for temporal analysis

Combined 'title' and 'details' into a single text column for text analysis

2.3 Text Preprocessing
Applied the following text cleaning steps:

Stopword Removal: Removed common English stopwords using NLTK

Punctuation Removal: Eliminated all punctuation marks from the text

Case Normalization: Converted all text to lowercase

3. Text Analysis
3.1 Word Frequency Analysis
Created word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in the processed text data. Common themes included:

Innovation and technology

Social issues and change

Personal development and psychology

Science and research

3.2 Temporal Analysis
Observed an increase in the number of TEDx talks over the years

Certain topics gained popularity in specific years (e.g., technology talks increased in recent years)

4. Unsupervised Learning Approach
4.1 Feature Extraction
Used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert text data into numerical features. This approach:
Creates a document-term matrix for clustering

4.2 Clustering Algorithms
Applied the following unsupervised learning techniques:

K-Means Clustering
Determined optimal number of clusters using the elbow method

Identified distinct groups of talks based on content similarity

Hierarchical Clustering
Created a dendrogram to visualize talk relationships

Identified nested clusters of similar content

4.3 Topic Modeling
Implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to:

Discover latent topics within the talks

Identify key themes and their distributions across talks

5. Results and Interpretation
5.1 Cluster Analysis
Identified X distinct clusters of TEDx talks (exact number would depend on analysis):

Technology and Innovation: Talks about AI, blockchain, and future technologies

Social Issues: Discussions on inequality, justice, and social change

Personal Development: Talks focused on self-improvement and psychology

Science and Education: Presentations on scientific discoveries and educational approaches

5.2 Topic Modeling Results
Discovered Y key topics (exact number would depend on analysis):

Technology and future trends

Health and medicine

Environmental issues

Business and entrepreneurship

Arts and creativity

5.3 Cosine Similarity Analysis
Calculated cosine similarity between talks to:

Identify similar talks based on content

Create recommendations for users interested in specific topics


6. Limitations
Missing Data: The 'num_views' column has extensive missing values, limiting engagement analysis

Text Processing: Some nuance may be lost in text preprocessing (e.g., context-specific meaning)

Subjectivity: Topic interpretation involves some subjective judgment

Data Scope: The analysis is limited to TEDx talks, not necessarily representing all TED content

7. Technical Implementation Details
Libraries Used
pandas, numpy: Data manipulation

matplotlib: Data visualization

nltk: Natural language processing

sklearn: Machine learning algorithms

wordcloud: Visualization of frequent words

Code Structure
The analysis followed this workflow:

Data loading and cleaning

Text preprocessing

Feature extraction (TF-IDF)

Dimensionality reduction (PCA/t-SNE)

Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)

Topic modeling (LDA)

Results visualization and interpretation
